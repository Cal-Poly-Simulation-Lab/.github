# Who are we?

The Cal Poly Simulation Laboratory is a group of students working on projects involving modeling and simulation of aerospace systems.  We engage in three primary activities: 

1. Design, build and test systems to determine and control the attitude of software and hardware simulations of spacecraft. 

2. Students develop skills in software modeling and simulation and apply those skills to aerospace systems, students will develop skills in several classes of modeling and simulation techniques ranging from numerical, Mote Carlo, Biomimetic, and Agent based simulations using a variety of coding tools and languages. 

3. We collaborate with other students to develop position papers, blogs, and social media posts on the peaceful, sustainable, and socially just use of space and space-based technologies. 

Students will gain experience in spacecraft navigational systems through modeling, simulation, design, build, and test activities.  Students will also host panel sessions, workshops, and other forums with a focus on the peaceful, sustainable, and socially just use of space and space technology.
